# 📊 Social Media Usage and Academic Performance - Survey Project  

This repository contains all materials and findings from our survey project, conducted as part of the **STAT 22632 - Survey Methods & Sampling Techniques** course at the **University of Kelaniya**. The project investigates the relationship between **social media usage** and the **academic performance** of undergraduates in the Faculty of Science.  

## 📌 Objectives  

1. To determine the effect of social media on students' GPAs.  
2. To identify the most commonly used social media platforms among undergraduates.  
3. To examine how social media usage patterns differ across academic years.  
4. To explore the purposes of social media usage (academic, entertainment, etc.) and its impact.  
5. To provide insights for improving time management and academic engagement.

## 📋 Project Highlights  

- **Sample Size**:  
   381 undergraduates from all four years of the Faculty of Science.  

- **Key Platforms Analyzed**:  
   - WhatsApp, YouTube, Facebook, Google Scholar, ResearchGate, and more.  

- **Findings**:  
   - Final-year students use social media more for **academic purposes** than earlier years.  
   - Students with moderate social media use (e.g., 3–4 hours/day) tend to have better GPAs.  
   - Overuse leads to issues like **disturbed sleep patterns**, **missed deadlines**, and **reduced concentration**.
